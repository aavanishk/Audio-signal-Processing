    C. Project Implementation 
</h1>

<p>
    The project was designed for processing the pre-recorded audio signals. In spite of that the audio signal  for Graphic Equalizer and Reverb Effect was designed such that the audio input is given through any live  input source using the function ‘audioDeviceReader’. The other inputs are given through file after  selecting the input audio and reading it accordingly.

    The implementation environment for the provided MATLAB codes is well-suited for audio engineers and  producers. MATLAB, equipped with its audio processing toolbox, offers a versatile platform for tasks  crucial to audio professionals. This environment facilitates signal processing, algorithm development,  and real-time simulation of audio effects. With powerful visualization tools, customizability, and a range  of functions for audio manipulation, MATLAB caters to the needs of those in the field, providing a  valuable resource for detailed analysis, prototyping, and experimentation in audio engineering and  production workflows.

    The audio file was required for the processing which normally included noise which was later on mixed  with Gaussian white noise and processed accordingly. The final shape of the project will take the form of  an extensive audio processing system that may include real-time processing capabilities, a graphical user  interface for user interaction, and hardware integration. For audio engineers and producers, usability  and efficiency are guaranteed through optimization and documentation.
