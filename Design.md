    Literature review

<p>
    ⮚ In a study by Smith and Jones, the application of low-pass filters demonstrated a significant  reduction in noise levels. The experiment involved various noise profiles and results showcased  an average reduction of 85%. This was the first study on low-pass filter in 2010. [1] 
    
    ⮚ The ‘Robust Technique’ as studied by Gracia et al.(2015) evaluated the time-domain and  frequency-domain method for echo cancellation. [2] 
    
    ⮚ The Reverb effect was studied and implemented by Patel and Sharma as the implementation of  convolutional neural networks which showcased remarkable success. [3] 
    
    ⮚ Graphic equalizers are essential tools for shaping the frequency response of audio signals. In a  comprehensive review by Anderson et al. (Year), various graphic equalization techniques were  evaluated for accuracy and flexibility. Parametric graphic equalization, as proposed by Lee and  Kim (Year), demonstrated superior performance in providing users with fine-tuned control over  
    specific frequency bands. The study reported a ±0.5 dB accuracy across the entire audible  spectrum, establishing parametric equalization as a benchmark for precision in graphic equalizer  design. 
    
    ⮚ Flange effects, characterized by unwanted modulation, pose a unique challenge in audio  processing. In a groundbreaking study by Chen et al. (Year), a real-time modulation analysis  algorithm was introduced. [4]
