<h1>
    CHALLANGES AND LIMITATION
</h1>

<p>
    The main challenges faced in design and major limitations in the project includes: 

    ⮚ Real time complexity: The implementation of the project in live audio stream would be a  challenge as the delicate balance algorithm required for the live audio signal processing is not  included in the code. 

    ⮚ The various noise profiles may confuse the important audio with the wide range of noises and  may cut it off in the process of filtering. 

    ⮚ The integration of multiple noise reduction modules and equalizer introduces challenges in  creating a friendly user interface to be used by a person with less technical knowledge. 
    
    ⮚ The generalization across various audio genres seems to be a challenge and may require area of  improvement.
