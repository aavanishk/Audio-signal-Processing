    Conclusion and Recommendations 
</h1>

<p>
    The project was concluded with the major application in audio processing. The objective was full filled  with application of filters, equalizers, functions and effects to process the audio in the aimed frequency  and bandwidth. MATLAB was used in coding and some of the inbuilt functions were used in the  completion of the project.
</p>
<p> 
    The main unexplored aspects of the projects were time and resource constraints. Further genre-specific  optimization, dataset study and implementation, resource optimization and area specific audio study is  the main area to be looked after for the proper use of the project in major areas and for wider  applications. 
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion, while the project has reached its objective, the ongoing challenges can be explored and  real-time complexity can be tamed with proper implementation for the use in a wider scale and proper  application.
