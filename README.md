<h1>A. Introduction </h1>
<p>
This project revolves around the enhancement of audio quality through noise reduction techniques. It  aims to provide sharper audio experiences removing the various challenges in the process of audio  recording, transmission and processing. 
</p>
<h2>Backgrond</h2>
<p>This project idea was brought up from the regular issues of sound and audio contamination by various  undesired noise such as background and ambient noise or echoes that affect the recoding process.  These various issues affects the audio recording quality and the project aims to avoid such scenarios. </p>
<h2>Motivation</h2> 
<p>The main motivation for selection of the project is to improve the quality of audio content in the era  dominated by podcasts, music and various other multimedia recordings. Also, it is aimed to help the  content creation individuals' categories. 
</p>
<H2>Objectives</H2>
<p>The main objectives includes the implementation of the processing techniques for noise reduction.  These include the integration of a basic filter to process high-frequency noise, an echo effect reduction  mechanism to remove reverberations, a flange effect to reduce unwanted modulation, and a graphic  equalizer for tuning various frequency responses.  
</p>
<h2>Achievements</h2> 
<p>The ultimate achievements includes: 
    ⮚ The use of low pass filtering mechanisms to avoid the high frequency note. ⮚ Creation of echo from a sharp audio. 

    ⮚ The reduction of modulated sound using flange effect. 
    
    ⮚ The tuning of audio frequency using graphic equalizer.
